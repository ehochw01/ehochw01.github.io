	<h1>Biography</h1>
	<p>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a third year computer science major and music engineering minor looking for a summer internship in Software Development or Software Engineering. Besides my interest in programming, I also have interests in music technology and medicine as I have completed the pre-medicine courses in Chemistry, Biology, and Physics. </br>
	
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At Tufts, I have maintained a 3.48/4.0 GPA and an average of 3.89 in my computer science classes. These classes have taught me proper programming etiquette and have allowed me to develop attention to detail. In my Data Structures class I created a boggle game in C++ that was a combination of three smaller programs; one that would solve for all of the correct words on a board, one that would allow users to check if their words were correct, and one that would score the user&nbsps words. This project and others like it have allowed me to hone my skills in object-oriented programming and expand my knowledge of different data structures. <br/>
		
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I also have fairly extensive exposure to the medical field. I have learned a lot about private healthcare administration while working in my father&nbsps office, the Long Island Hand to Shoulder Center, throughout High School and during the summer after my freshman year. In addition to my medical office experience, I have shadowed doctors in the hospital setting in both the Emergency and Operating Room. These exposures to the medical field have allowed me to learn about the dynamics of American healthcare system. <br/>
		
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beyond the classroom, I have participated in several activities that have helped me build teamwork and leadership skills. Firstly, I assist in a Biophysics lab. This research experience has exposed me to novel technology and allowed me to develop different technical skills. In this position I have had the opportunity to work on a collaborative team to successfully achieve the goals of the lab. Secondly, I am VP of Relations of ChangeFire at Tufts University which is a small group of students that organizes service projects in Latin America. This position has allowed me to participate in the Millenium Fellowship in Boston which is an 8-month leadership accelerator that convenes student leaders across universities to improve their student organizations, partnerships, and community impact. I wish to take the leadership skills that I learned from this fellowship and apply them in the context of the professional world. <br/>
